    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently enrolled in the U of M Coding Boot Camp for web development while I work part time at REI. My background is in Geology. I studied sedimentology and Andean tectonics at San Diego State University after which I worked in environmental consulting in up state New York. I decided to enroll in this class because I wanted to learn to code to either pair with my geology background or use to start a new career.

    Hobbies of mine include biking, backpacking, camping, and traveling. I have moved around a lot and my hobbies have adapted with me. Minnesota has awesome biking, cross country skiing, and canoeing! I hope this summer to backpack part of the Superior Hiking Trail!
